# Installation

This part gives you a step by step guide how to install the project-setup.

## Steps

- create local database instance (not needed for installation itself, but for WordPress later)
- copy content of `.env.example` to `.env`
- fill out the required environment variables
  - check the [configuration](./Configuration.md) section to see which are required
- run `composer install`
- run `yarn` in the theme-folder - `/web/app/themes/towa-theme/`

That's it! ✌️
